# Word2Vec-Visualization

### 1. Word2Vec with Gensim:

Demonstrates Word2Vec implementation using Gensim library.   
Includes steps for training Word2Vec models and visualizing word vectors by performing PCA.   
utilized both custom datasets and pre-trained models in gensim.    
Trained word2Vec on large corpus like text8.   

### 2.Word2Vec from Scratch with CBOW:

Illustrates Word2Vec implementation from scratch using a Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) approach.    
Involves steps for data preprocessing, model training, and word embedding extraction.       
And provides insights into finding similar words using the trained embeddings.
